          <li>GitHub is a cloud based version control platform that allows developers to work together on coding projects.</li>
          <li>Through git, a developer can create and work on new branches without overwriting the main branch and breaking important code.</li>
          <li>Once the changes have been made, a developer and commit the changes, and create a pull request.</li>
          <li>Typically, a pull request involves other devs checking the fixed code and collaborating to fix or validate said code.</li>
          <li>Once the pull request is validated, the changes from the feature branch are then merged into the main branch.</li>

          <li>For loop is more efficient for large amounts of data. It uses a predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array, by executing a single line of code repeatedly.</li>
